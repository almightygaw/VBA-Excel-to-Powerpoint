Client request: Monthly Excel file containing names of employees and charts for each employee all together. For each employee, generate PowerPoint file and copy all Excel charts for specified employee to PowerPoint
slide.

Issues: I noticed that running this macro for all employees at once worked for about ten employees, but then Excel crashed. To address this, the macro asks user to type desired employee name into a text box,
then macro runs for that employee alone. Not 100% automated due to this, but much faster than manually copying/pasting/dragging/resizing numerous charts for each employee.
